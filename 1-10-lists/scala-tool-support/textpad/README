* Introduction

This directory contains an additional syntax definition file (.syn) for
Scala programs.

More information about TextPad (Windows only) is available from:

   http://www.textpad.com/

* Installation

Copy the file "scala.syn" to the following location:

   <TextPad_instdir>/system/

Start the TextPad text editor with NO opened files. Select the entry
"New Document Class.." from the menu "Configure" and follow the
instructions. For example:

   Document class name       : Scala
   Class members             : *.scala
   Syntax definition file    : scala.syn
   Enable syntax highlighting: yes

From that point on, loading a file whose name ends in ".scala" automatically
turns Scala mode on.
